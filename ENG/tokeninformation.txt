Concept description 3 - 10 sentences:
THE CHALLENGE
Suffering from income inequality, financial problems and without alternatives, a growing number of people can’t afford appropriate housing, access to resources and thus enjoy the benefits of sustainable technological innovations.

OUR VISION
Imagine if people from different fields of expertise worked together to open source everything in the household. This way, technological breakthroughs will appear much faster in our daily life, instead of just in patent-protected R&D environments. We truly believe that the next industrial revolution is about exponential, open source technologies, large-scale cooperation, redistribution of resources and environmental sustainability all at the same time.
ENVIENTA is a next generation sharing economy model, a DIY maker movement, a community-based solution package and ultimately a sustainable, cost-effective and decentralized socioeconomic framework for the 21st century. ENVIENTA is also a P2P open source platform cooperative, which provides shared know-how, blueprints, products and resources for members.
