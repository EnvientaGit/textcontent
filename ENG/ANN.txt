[b][size=20pt][color=navy]I. WHAT IS ENVIENTA?[/color][/size][/b]

[size=17pt][b][color=navy]THE CHALLENGE[/color][/b][/size]
[size=13pt]Suffering from income inequality, financial problems and without alternatives, growing number of people can’t afford appropriate housing, access to resources and enjoy the benefits of sustainable technological innovations.[/size]


[size=17pt][b][color=navy]OUR VISION[/color][/b][/size]


[size=13pt]Imagine if people from different fields of expertise work together to open source everything in the household. This way, the technological breakthroughs appear way faster into our daily life, instead of patent-protected R&D environments. We truly believe that the next industrial revolution is about exponential open source technologies, large scale cooperation, redistribution of resources and environmental sustainability at the same time.[/size]

[b][size=20pt][color=navy]ENVIENTA OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING[/color][/size][/b]


[size=13pt]ENVIENTA is a next generation sharing economy model, a DIY maker movement, a community-based solution package and ultimately the sustainable, cost-effective and decentralized socioeconomic framework of the 21st century. ENVIENTA is also a P2P open source platform cooperative, which provides share of know-how, blueprints, products and resources for the members. We're operating as a community controlled initiative with full transparency and as a registered non-profit organization in Spain and Hungary.[/size]

[b][size=25pt][color=navy]THEORY OF EVERYTHING[/color][/size][/b]
[size=15pt]When things we produce and our homes become a mini-IoT infrastructure that connect communities across regions, the economic paradigm changes.[/size]

[center][b][size=20pt][color=blue]HOW DO WE GET THERE ?[/color][/size][/b][/center]


[b][size=20pt][color=navy]II. TOKEN RELEASE AND IMPLEMENTATION[/color][/size][/b]

[size=15pt]ENVIENTA is a bottom-up initiative that, thanks to the open source approach, can be a source of radical changes. Here we offer a stake by ENVIENTA ICO.
The implementation is divided into four phases, depending on how many tokens will we be able to sell and how much capital can we collect.

[b][size=25pt][color=navy]PHASE 1 - ENVIENTA PROJECT CENTER | 1000 ETH (SOFT CAP)[/color][/size][/b]


[size=13pt]Building the first project center on Canary Islands, Spain. Our investment plans are always adjusting to the local weather and environmental conditions, containing the easiest locally available and possibly recyclable materials, considering the available expertise and workforce to reduce the expenses. We're using the latest available technology during the constructions and focusing on the combination of accommodation, food supply and local production with a fully digital E-Manufactory. ENVIENTA ultimately provides cheap and well-designed living for individuals, families and communities as an IoT based alternative lifestyle of the near future.

[b][size=20pt][color=navy]PHASE 2 - ENVIENTA EDUCATION | 1000 - 2000 ETH[/color][/size][/b]
[size=13pt]If we can acquire the capital needed for Phase 2, we can develop further our training program and spread ENVIENTA’s philosophy and know-how in big volume. Some of these courses and MOOCS are free of charge and available online thanks to the commons approach. Educating useful techniques to address local and global challenges, inspiring and empowering citizens, students, cultural workers, entrepreneurs, adult educators, facilitators of change, coaches and communities wanting to develop collaborative and participatory practices to empower social change and steward resources. ENVIENTA is committed to creating positive global impact through the millions of people who benefit from our ongoing programs and activities.[/size]

[b][size=20pt][color=navy]PHASE 3 - ENVIENTA PLATFORM | 2000 - 3000 ETH[/color][/size][/b]


[size=13pt]The really interesting things can be done in Phase 3. The goal here is to develop further and finalize our software platform. ENVIENTA is the first crowdfunding platform aims to speed up the collaborative open source product development, from ideas to prototypes, sales/distribution throughout their life cycle based on circular economy principles.[/size]
[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/S43VzDL.jpg[/img][/center]
[size=15pt]Basically, open source hardware developments are the primary target area, but we also support the development of software and even new social and economic models (e.g. DAOs). Developing the ENVIENTA platform will serve as a kind of startup incubator and as an additional center of other open source hardware projects. The platform will provide collaborative services for the developers for free, will provide legal protection for open source projects and help bring demand and supply together[/size]

[b][size=20pt][color=navy]PHASE 4 - PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION | 3000 - 5000 ETH (HARD CAP)[/color][/size][/b]

[size=13pt]Phase 4 is the implementation of decentralized production and distribution. This is the last step where ideas from the platform can become real, tangible products and we have to provide financial, marketing and manufacturing related analysis continuously to the open source hardware.
As ENVIENTA will never have a huge development team, we certainly do not want to put production lines into service. Instead, we will create a kind of franchise system that will make it possible for anyone to become a manufacturer of ENVIENTA products, giving an endlessly scalable manufacturing capacity to all. To apply, several conditions must be met by that manufacturer. These will include support for open source projects as well as the support for ENVIENTA also. So you can build a lean business model around open source hardware.

[b][size=15pt][color=navy]Project Name:[/color] ENVIENTA[/size]
[size=15pt][color=navy]Token Symbol:[/color] ENV

[color=navy][size=13pt]Soft Cap:[/size][/color] 1,000 ETH
[color=navy][size=13pt]Hard Cap:[/size][/color] 5,000 ETH
(ICO contributors own 47,4% of total token supply if hard cap is reached)[/center]

[b][size=13pt][color=navy]Maximum Market Cap at ICO: [/color]12,000 ETH if Hard Cap is reached[/size][/b]

[b][size=13pt][color=navy]Bonus Structure: [/color]1 ETH = 100 ENV[/size][/b]

[img]https://i.imgur.com/lL1Q3OF.jpg[/img]
[size=13pt]100 ENV (ENVIENTA token) is worth 1 ETH. During the ICO token sale campaign, we highly value our first investors, thus we have defined the following bonus structure. The first milestone is reaching an investment of 1000 ETH (this is what we call a soft cap). This amount is enough to make the first phase of our project come true. In short, if you invest into the ENVIENTA ICO during the first phase of collecting 1000 ETH, for every token bought, the smart contract will credit you 1.3 times more in your ERC20 wallet.

Between 1000 and 2000 ETH the multiplier is 1.15, so for every ETH invested, instead of 100 ENV, the system will allocate 115 ENV to you..
During the campaign, 100 ENV (ENVIENTA token) is worth 1 ETH.
+ 30% bonus for contributors before reaching soft cap (1,000 ETH)
+ 15% bonus before reaching 2,000 ETH
